## Understanding codebase interface
I want to understand how we currently passes variables between our frontend with our backend when we send a message and get a response from agent in @ChatInterface.tsx Please go through the codebase, and report the whole process. I want to learn how the context and message parameters are passed. Report this in details

## Review
Please make a task checklist before you start working on it. And when you're done, go through the key files to review if the implementation is correct and free of error.

## Smart, Clean, Think Hard
Is this the smartest way? or the cleanest way to implement? Think hard

## Chek -> Do -> Review 
Double check and read relevant files before you implement this. Review to make sure it is done correctly afterwards

## start checklist
Now follow the checklist and continue to make progress until it is complete. Make clean implementation and avoid quick fixes. Update the checklist with what you've learned at the end.
