## Understanding codebase interface
I want to understand how we currently passes variables between our frontend with our backend when we send a message and get a response from agent in @ChatInterface.tsx Please go through the codebase, and report the whole process. I want to learn how the context and message parameters are passed. Report this in details

## Review
Please make a task checklist before you start working on it. And when you're done, go through the key files to review if the implementation is correct and free of error.
