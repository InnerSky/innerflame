Always use environment-aware API URLs to handle differences between development and production.

// Use environment variables for API URLs
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '';

// Use the base URL in all API requests
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/endpoint`, {...});

In development, Vite's proxy handles relative URLs, but in production, you must explicitly set the full domain.
