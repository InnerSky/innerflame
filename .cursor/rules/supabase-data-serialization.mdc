When sending complex data (especially arrays) to Supabase, always force proper serialization:

// Force JSON serialization/deserialization before sending to Supabase
const data = {
  complexData: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(yourComplexObject))
};

await supabase
  .from('your_table')
  .update(data)
  .eq('id', recordId);

This ensures consistent behavior across all environments by normalizing the data structure before transmission.
These practices are crucial for maintaining behavior consistency between development and production environments.
