# Start Every Session Here

## Welcome to the InnerFlame Project

This document is the starting point for every development session on the InnerFlame project. It will guide you to the appropriate milestone and phase files to review before beginning work.

## Key Agent Behaviors

1. **Mandatory Technical Review**: Before writing any code or making any changes, you MUST thoroughly review the `technical_blueprint.md` to understand existing implementations, patterns, and feature documentation.

2. **UI-First Development**: Always prioritize interface components before backend implementation:
   - Build interfaces first with mock data
   - Then implement simplified business logic
   - Finally, increase implementation complexity after verification

3. **Document Updates Required**: After implementing any feature or making any changes:
   - Update `technical_blueprint.md` with new implementations or modifications
   - Ensure feature sections within the technical blueprint reflect current status

4. **Incremental Development**: Follow the progression:
   - Interface First → Simple Logic → Incremental Complexity → Verification

## Current Project Status

**Current Milestone**: Milestone 1 - Services & Configuration
**Current Phase**: Phase 1
**Current Phase File**: `milestone_1_current/phase_1_checklist_current.md`

## Before You Begin

1. Review `project_description.md` for overall project vision and roadmap
2. **CRITICAL**: Thoroughly review `technical_blueprint.md` to understand all existing implementations
3. Review the current milestone overview at `milestone_1_current/milestone_overview.md`
4. Check the current phase checklist at `milestone_1_current/phase_1_checklist_current.md`
