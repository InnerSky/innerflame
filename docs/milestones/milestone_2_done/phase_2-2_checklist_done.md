# Phase 2-2: Server-Side Persistence for AI Messages

This phase focuses on implementing server-side persistence for AI assistant messages to ensure they are saved to Supabase when streaming is complete, regardless of client connection status.

## Tasks

### Understanding the Current Implementation
- [x] Review the `useChatInterface.ts` hook to understand the current client-side message saving approach
- [x] Examine the server-side streaming implementation in `sseClient.ts` and related backend files
- [x] Review the `MessageService.ts` implementation for message saving to Supabase
- [x] Analyze the `handleStreamRequest` function in the backend to understand streaming flow

### Server-Side Message Persistence Implementation
- [x] Modify backend streaming endpoint to create a placeholder assistant message when streaming begins
- [x] Update SSE streaming implementation to save the complete message content when streaming finishes
- [x] Add message status field to track streaming state ('streaming', 'complete', 'error')
- [x] Ensure message ID consistency between server and client for proper message tracking

### Client-Side Updates
- [x] Update `useChatInterface.ts` to handle pre-saved messages from server
- [x] Remove client-side message creation logic for assistant messages
- [x] Update message display to properly handle message status for streaming vs completed messages
- [x] Add reconnection handling for interrupted streams

### Documentation Updates
- [x] Update technical blueprint with the new server-side persistence approach
- [x] Document the new message status field in the data schema section
- [x] Update API endpoint documentation to reflect changes

## Success Criteria
- [x] Assistant messages are saved to Supabase from the server side when streaming completes
- [x] Messages persist correctly even if the client disconnects during streaming
- [x] Client properly displays streaming and completed messages with correct states
- [x] Implementation follows the technical blueprint patterns and conventions
