# Phase 1-2: Responsive Layout Refactoring

## Objective
Improve the Documents page structure by creating a more maintainable and consistent approach to handling responsive layouts, reducing code duplication and improving separation of concerns.

## Checklist

### Layout Component Structure
- [x] 1. Create a `layouts` directory within the documents feature
- [x] 2. Create a `DocumentsDesktopLayout.tsx` component for desktop view
- [x] 3. Create a `DocumentsMobileLayout.tsx` component for mobile view
- [x] 4. Create a `DocumentsResponsiveLayout.tsx` wrapper component that chooses between layouts

### Common Components Extraction
- [x] 5. Extract `DocumentsHeader` component from both layouts
- [x] 6. Extract `DocumentWorkspace` component (content area with editor and chat)
- [x] 7. Extract `DocumentEmptyState` component (shown when no document is selected)
- [x] 8. Create a `ModalContainer` component to manage all modals consistently

### Wiring It All Together
- [x] 9. Update the main Documents page to use the new responsive layout
- [x] 10. Remove duplicated layout code from Documents.tsx
- [x] 11. Fix type errors in the DocumentsContext and layout components
- [x] 12. Test both desktop and mobile views

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced code duplication between mobile and desktop layouts
- Improved maintainability with smaller, focused components
- Clearer separation between layout logic and business logic
- Consistent behavior across different screen sizes
- Better code organization

## Progress Notes
- Created layouts directory and extracted layout components
- Implemented responsive layout selection based on screen size
- Extracted common UI components for better reusability
- Significantly reduced the size of Documents.tsx (from ~750 lines to ~350 lines)
- Fixed mobile drawer behavior
- Resolved type errors related to document types and operations
- Maintained compatibility with existing DocumentContext consumers

## Next Steps
This refactoring prepares the Documents page for easier integration of future features like the chat interface. The modular architecture now makes it easier to:

1. Add new UI components without cluttering the main document component
2. Implement different behaviors for mobile and desktop while sharing core functionality
3. Modify layouts independently without affecting business logic
4. Add new modals or UI elements in a consistent way

The chat interface is now properly integrated and can be enhanced with AI capabilities in upcoming phases.
