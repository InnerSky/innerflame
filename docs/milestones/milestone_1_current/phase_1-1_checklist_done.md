# Phase 1-1: Document Context Provider for Chat Interface

## Objective
Prepare the Documents page for a chat interface integration by implementing a context-based approach that makes document and project state easily accessible to new components.

## Checklist

### Context Implementation
- [x] 1. Create a `DocumentsContext.tsx` file to define the context and provider
- [x] 2. Define types for context including document/project state and operations
- [x] 3. Create context hook (`useDocumentsContext`) for consuming components

### Documents Page Updates
- [x] 4. Import and wrap the Documents page content with the DocumentsProvider
- [x] 5. Construct the context value using existing state and functions
- [x] 6. Ensure both mobile and desktop layouts are wrapped correctly

### Chat Interface Implementation
- [x] 7. Create a `ChatInterface.tsx` component with basic UI
- [x] 8. Connect the chat component to DocumentsContext
- [x] 9. Add the chat interface to document workspace area

### Testing and Verification  
- [x] 10. Test context access from chat component
- [x] 11. Verify project and document state is correctly accessible
- [x] 12. Ensure the UI layout integrates well in both mobile and desktop views

## Next Steps
Upon completion, the Documents page will be ready for the chat interface feature to be enhanced with actual AI integration in the subsequent phase.

## Progress Notes
- Created DocumentsContext to provide document and project state to components
- Implemented type-safe context with proper TypeScript definitions
- Added ChatInterface component that demonstrates accessing document and project state
- Integrated chat interface into both mobile and desktop layouts
- Set up mock implementation that shows document and project context is accessible
- The chat interface is now ready for actual AI integration in future work
