# Phase 2: Backend Foundation & API Setup

## Overview
This phase focuses on setting up the backend foundation and implementing the API infrastructure using tRPC and Supabase. We will establish the server structure, implement authentication middleware, and set up basic API endpoints.

## Tasks

### Backend Service Structure
- [ ] Set up Express/Node.js server in `apps/api/`
- [ ] Implement tRPC server setup
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets management
- [ ] Set up Supabase connection

### API Implementation
- [ ] Create API router structure with tRPC
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for core entities
- [ ] Set up authentication middleware with Supabase JWT validation
- [ ] Configure Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for streaming responses

### AI Service Foundation
- [ ] Set up initial LangGraph.js implementation
- [ ] Create basic agent structure with document playbook loading
- [ ] Implement tool calling infrastructure for document updates
- [ ] Configure AI request handling and response streaming
