# Phase 1-3: IDE-Style Layout with Split Document and Chat Views

## Objective
Redesign the Documents interface to adopt an IDE-like layout with the document editor on the left and chat interface on the right for desktop view. For mobile, implement a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between document and chat views with tabs, panning, and swipe gestures.

## Checklist

### Review and Understanding
- [x] 1. Review current Document layout components to understand the structure
- [x] 2. Review current DocumentWorkspace component to understand how editor and chat are currently integrated
- [x] 3. Examine existing mobile interaction patterns and animation implementations

### Desktop Layout Redesign
- [x] 4. Update DocumentsDesktopLayout to implement the IDE-like split view
- [ ] 5. Create a resizable split pane between document and chat (optional)
- [x] 6. Ensure proper styling and responsiveness of the split view

### Mobile Layout Enhancement
- [x] 7. Create TabBar component for mobile view to switch between document and chat
- [x] 8. Implement tab-based navigation between document and chat views
- [x] 9. Add horizontal swipe gesture support for changing views
- [x] 10. Add transition animations for tab switching and swiping

### Component Updates
- [x] 11. Refactor DocumentWorkspace to support split rendering of editor and chat
- [x] 12. Update the chat interface component for standalone rendering
- [x] 13. Ensure proper state management between document and chat views

### Testing and Refinement
- [x] 14. Test desktop split view functionality
- [x] 15. Test mobile tab switching and swipe interactions
- [x] 16. Fix any layout or styling issues
- [x] 17. Ensure consistent behavior across screen sizes and orientations

## Expected Outcomes
- ✅ IDE-like layout with document on left, chat on right for desktop
- ✅ Mobile interface with tab navigation between document and chat views
- ✅ Gesture support for swiping between views on mobile
- ✅ Smooth transitions and animations for view changes
- ✅ Consistent user experience across device types

## Progress Notes
- Started by reviewing the current document layout structure. The application has a responsive layout system with separate components for desktop and mobile views, managed by DocumentsResponsiveLayout.tsx. The mobile layout already has a drawer system with animations using Framer Motion.

- Examined DocumentWorkspace component which currently renders the DocumentEditor and ChatInterface in a vertical stack (column) for both desktop and mobile. The chat interface is rendered as a Card component below the document editor.

- Reviewed animation patterns in the mobile layout which uses Framer Motion for smooth transitions. This will be helpful for implementing the mobile tab swiping functionality.

- Created a new DocumentTabBar component to enable switching between document and chat views in mobile layout.

- Refactored the DocumentWorkspace component to support both desktop and mobile layouts:
  - Desktop: Split view with document editor on left, chat on right
  - Mobile: Tabbed interface with swipe gesture support

- Updated the ChatInterface component to be more flexible:
  - Added support for standalone mode (used in mobile tab view)
  - Improved styling for both desktop sidebar and mobile fullscreen views
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing implementations

- Updated the desktop layout with the new IDE-style split view, adjusting padding and layout constraints.
  
- Updated the mobile layout to use the new tabbed workspace with proper height constraints.

- Added appropriate props to the ChatInterface in the DocumentWorkspace to ensure it works correctly in both mobile and desktop environments.

- Tested the implementation and confirmed that:
  - Desktop view now shows document and chat side-by-side in an IDE-like layout
  - Mobile view allows switching between document and chat with tabs
  - Swiping left/right works to change tabs on mobile
  - Animations provide smooth transitions between views

## Next Steps
This updated layout provides a significantly improved user experience for both desktop and mobile users. The next phase could focus on:

1. Implementing a resizable split pane between document and chat on desktop
2. Enhancing the AI chat capabilities to better assist with document editing
3. Adding context-aware suggestions based on document content
4. Improving mobile performance for complex documents
