# Phase 1: Monorepo Structure & Configuration

## Overview
This phase focuses on establishing the monorepo structure and configuring the build system for the InnerFlame project. We will reorganize the existing frontend code and set up the foundation for the backend service.

## Tasks

### Root Package Setup
- [x] Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
- [x] Set up shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations
- [x] Configure Git hooks and linting rules

### Project Reorganization
- [x] Create `apps/` directory for application code
  - [x] Move existing frontend to `apps/web/`
  - [x] Create `apps/api/` for the backend service
- [x] Create `packages/` directory for shared code
  - [x] Create `packages/types/` for shared TypeScript interfaces
  - [x] Create `packages/ui/` for shared UI components
  - [x] Create `packages/utils/` for shared utility functions
  - [x] Create `packages/ai-tools/` for LangGraph tools implementation
- [x] Clean up the root directory
  - [x] Remove duplicate configuration files from root after migration
  - [x] Update Netlify configuration for monorepo structure
  - [x] Resolve path resolution issues in migrated codebase

### Build System Configuration
- [x] Set up build scripts for all packages
- [x] Configure dev server for local development
- [x] Ensure proper TypeScript path aliases

## Progress Notes

- Created the monorepo structure with apps and packages directories
- Set up Turborepo configuration for build pipeline
- Created package.json files for all workspaces
- Established TypeScript configurations with proper path aliases
- Created basic structure for shared packages with type definitions and utilities
- Set up Express server for the API service
- Prepared the structure for the web application
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues with declaration options
- Implemented basic UI components for the shared UI package
- Added AI tools for document updates and user interaction
- Configured Git hooks with Husky and lint-staged
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Migrated existing frontend code to the web app structure
- Resolved import resolution issues with ThemeContext and other components
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the migrated codebase, including property naming inconsistencies
- Removed redundant configuration files from the root directory to avoid confusion
- Updated Netlify deployment configuration to properly build from the monorepo structure
- Created a clean project structure with clear separation between applications and shared packages

## Next Steps
- Rename this file to phase_1_checklist_done.md
- Create phase_2_checklist_current.md for the next phase: Backend Foundation & API Setup
- Begin implementing the backend service with tRPC and Supabase integration
