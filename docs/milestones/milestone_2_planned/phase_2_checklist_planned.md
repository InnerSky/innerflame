# Phase 2 Checklist: Frontend Integration with SSE Streaming

## Objective
Integrate the LangGraph agent with the existing ChatInterface component using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming responses.

## Tasks

### SSE Implementation
- [ ] Set up SSE endpoint in the backend
  - [ ] Implement SSE controller for streaming responses
  - [ ] Configure proper headers and connection handling
  - [ ] Set up reconnection mechanism for dropped connections
  - [ ] Implement error handling for SSE streams
- [ ] Add streaming support to LangGraph agent
  - [ ] Modify agent to support incremental response generation
  - [ ] Implement token chunking for efficient streaming
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for agent operations
  - [ ] Ensure tool calls don't interrupt the streaming flow

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update ChatInterface to connect to backend service
  - [ ] Implement SSE client for receiving streamed responses
  - [ ] Add connection state handling (connecting, connected, disconnected)
  - [ ] Set up error handling and reconnection logic
  - [ ] Ensure proper display of incremental message updates
- [ ] Add message persistence
  - [ ] Save messages to Supabase during streaming
  - [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
  - [ ] Sync message state between frontend and backend

### Tool Execution Enhancement
- [ ] Improve the document update tool
  - [ ] Add validation for document updates
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for failed updates
  - [ ] Add logging for tool execution
  - [ ] Create a mechanism to display tool execution status in UI
- [ ] Add a user interaction tool
  - [ ] Implement basic user question capability
  - [ ] Set up conversation state preservation during interactions
  - [ ] Enable the agent to resume after user responses

### Context-Aware Responses
- [ ] Enhance agent with document awareness
  - [ ] Add document metadata to agent context
  - [ ] Implement project information in prompts
  - [ ] Create mechanism to access document content for referencing
  - [ ] Add basic intent detection for messages

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create end-to-end testing suite
  - [ ] Test SSE connection with various network conditions
  - [ ] Validate streaming behavior with large responses
  - [ ] Test tool execution during streaming
  - [ ] Ensure proper error recovery
- [ ] Implement frontend integration tests
  - [ ] Test ChatInterface integration with backend
  - [ ] Validate message rendering and formatting
  - [ ] Test error handling in the UI

## Verification Criteria
1. ChatInterface successfully connects to the backend service
2. AI responses stream in real-time with visible typing effect
3. Messages are properly saved to the database during streaming
4. Document update tool executes correctly during conversation
5. User interaction tool properly pauses and resumes the conversation
6. Context-awareness properly references documents and projects
7. Connection interruptions are handled gracefully with reconnection

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 implementation
- ChatInterface.tsx component
- Supabase for message storage
- Document and Project interfaces

## Notes
- Start with small incremental updates to ensure streaming works properly
- Use console logging extensively for debugging the streaming process
- Test on various network conditions including slow connections
- Temporarily simplify some aspects if needed to get core functionality working
