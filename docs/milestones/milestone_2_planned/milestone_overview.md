# Milestone 2: Basic LangGraph Agent Implementation

## Overview
This milestone focuses on creating the foundational AI backend service using LangGraph.js with Claude API integration. We'll develop a minimal but functional agent that can respond to user queries through our existing chat interface while demonstrating basic tool execution capabilities. The backend will be deployed to Google Cloud Run for proper testing and validation.

## Objectives
1. Set up a backend service with Claude API integration
2. Implement a basic LangGraph agent flow
3. Enable server-side tool call execution
4. Configure SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses
5. Deploy the service to Google Cloud Run
6. Test integration with the existing ChatInterface.tsx component

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Backend service successfully connects to Claude API
- [ ] LangGraph agent processes user messages and returns contextually appropriate responses
- [ ] Server-side tool call interception and execution works for at least one basic tool
- [ ] Real-time streaming responses display progressively in the frontend via SSE
- [ ] ChatInterface.tsx successfully communicates with the deployed backend service
- [ ] The service can be deployed to Google Cloud Run with proper environment configuration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Backend Service with Basic LangGraph Agent
- Set up a new Node.js service in the apps/api directory with TypeScript and ESM
- Implement Claude API client with environment variable configuration
- Create a minimal LangGraph.js agent with basic workflow
- Set up basic system prompt and document update tool
- Create tRPC endpoints for agent interaction
- Implement a CLI testing tool for agent validation
- Add optional temporary integration with ChatInterface.tsx for early testing

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration with SSE Streaming
- Implement SSE endpoint for streaming AI responses
- Configure proper SSE connection handling and error recovery
- Add streaming support to LangGraph agent
- Update ChatInterface.tsx to connect to the backend service
- Implement message persistence during streaming
- Enhance document update tool with validation
- Add user interaction tool capability
- Implement context-aware responses with document metadata

### Phase 3: Deployment & Production Testing
- Configure Dockerfile for the backend service
- Set up Google Cloud Run deployment
- Implement secure environment variable management
- Add production security enhancements
- Optimize backend performance for production
- Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Create documentation for deployment and maintenance
- Set up monitoring and alerting

## Technical Dependencies
- Node.js backend with TypeScript and ESM
- Anthropic Claude API access and key
- LangGraph.js for agent orchestration
- tRPC for type-safe API endpoints
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming
- Google Cloud Run for deployment
- Existing ChatInterface.tsx component

## Integration Points
1. **Claude API**: Connection to Anthropic's Claude API for AI processing
2. **Frontend Chat Interface**: Integration with existing ChatInterface.tsx
3. **Database**: Messages stored in Supabase during conversations
4. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for securing API endpoints
5. **Document Context**: Access to project and document data for context-aware responses

## Documentation Updates
The following documentation will be created or updated during this milestone:
- Backend API documentation for new endpoints
- Environment variable configuration guide
- Deployment instructions for Google Cloud Run
- Testing protocols for AI agent functionality
- Updates to the technical blueprint reflecting the new implementation

## Verification Process
1. Manual testing of the chat interface with the deployed backend
2. Validation of message streaming functionality
3. Verification of tool call execution and response handling
4. Testing of error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
5. Performance assessment for response times and resource usage

## Next Steps After Completion
After successful implementation of this basic agent, we will proceed to:
1. Enhance the agent with more sophisticated tool capabilities
2. Implement document-aware context handling
3. Add specialized agents for different document types
4. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Optimize response quality with better prompt engineering
