# Phase 3 Checklist: Deployment & Production Testing

## Objective
Deploy the backend service to Google Cloud Run, set up proper environment configuration, and conduct comprehensive testing to validate the entire integrated system in a production environment.

## Tasks

### Google Cloud Run Setup
- [ ] Prepare the backend for deployment
  - [ ] Create a Dockerfile for the backend service
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for production
  - [ ] Configure build process for production deployment
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud Run service
  - [ ] Set up Google Cloud project and permissions
  - [ ] Configure scaling parameters and instance limits
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
  - [ ] Configure custom domain if needed

### Production Security
- [ ] Implement security enhancements
  - [ ] Audit authentication flow for production
  - [ ] Configure rate limiting for API endpoints
  - [ ] Set up CORS restrictions for production
  - [ ] Implement request validation middleware
- [ ] Secure secrets management
  - [ ] Set up Google Cloud Secret Manager
  - [ ] Configure secure environment variable handling
  - [ ] Remove any hardcoded secrets or credentials
  - [ ] Document security practices

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize backend performance
  - [ ] Configure caching strategies where appropriate
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling for database
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring
  - [ ] Optimize LangGraph agent for production
- [ ] Enhance streaming efficiency
  - [ ] Fine-tune token chunking for optimal performance
  - [ ] Configure timeouts and keep-alive settings
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for high load

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Perform end-to-end system testing
  - [ ] Test the complete user flow from UI to backend
  - [ ] Validate document context awareness
  - [ ] Test tool execution in production environment
  - [ ] Verify streaming performance under load
- [ ] Conduct error scenario testing
  - [ ] Test error handling for backend service crashes
  - [ ] Validate recovery from connection interruptions
  - [ ] Test error responses for invalid requests
  - [ ] Verify error logging and monitoring

### Documentation & Monitoring
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
  - [ ] Document deployment process step by step
  - [ ] Create runbook for common issues
  - [ ] Document environment variable requirements
  - [ ] Write API documentation for frontend integration
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
  - [ ] Configure logging for production
  - [ ] Set up error tracking and alerting
  - [ ] Implement usage metrics collection
  - [ ] Create dashboard for system health monitoring

## Verification Criteria
1. Backend service successfully deploys to Google Cloud Run
2. Service can handle multiple concurrent connections
3. System properly scales under varying load
4. Authentication works correctly in production environment
5. SSE streaming functions reliably in production
6. Tool execution works correctly with real data
7. Error scenarios are handled gracefully
8. Monitoring systems provide visibility into service health

## Dependencies
- Completed Phase 1 and 2 implementations
- Google Cloud Platform account and permissions
- Supabase production setup
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar)

## Notes
- Start with a staging deployment before moving to production
- Document every step of the deployment process
- Test with gradually increasing load to identify bottlenecks
- Set up proper logging from the beginning for easier debugging
- Consider setting up separate development/staging/production environments
