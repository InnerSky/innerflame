# Phase 2 Checklist: Frontend Integration with SSE Streaming

## Objective
Integrate the LangGraph agent with the existing ChatInterface component using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming responses, focusing only on essential functionality.

## Tasks

### SSE Implementation (Core Focus)
- [x] Set up SSE endpoint in the backend
  - [x] Implement SSE controller for streaming responses
  - [x] Configure proper headers and connection handling
  - [x] Implement basic error handling for SSE streams
- [x] Add streaming support to LangGraph agent
  - [x] Modify agent to support incremental response generation
  - [x] Implement basic tool handling during streaming

### Frontend Integration (Essential Only)
- [x] Update ChatInterface to connect to backend service with SSE
- [x] Create client utility for SSE connection
- [ ] Ensure proper display of incremental message updates
- [ ] Handle tool calls appropriately in the UI

### Tool Implementation (Focus on Core Tools)
- [x] Implement the editDocument tool
  - [x] Create server-side interception of tool calls
  - [x] Implement immediate acknowledgment of tool execution
  - [x] Add basic error handling for failed updates
- [ ] Implement the askUserQuestion tool
  - [ ] Enable agent to pause streaming when asking a question
  - [ ] Preserve conversation state while waiting for user response
  - [ ] Resume streaming when user provides an answer

### Testing (Basic Validation)
- [ ] Test SSE connection
- [ ] Test streaming response
- [ ] Test tool interactions

## Verification Criteria
1. [x] ChatInterface successfully connects to the backend service via SSE
2. [ ] AI responses stream in real-time with visible typing effect
3. [x] editDocument tool calls are properly intercepted and acknowledged
4. [ ] askUserQuestion tool correctly pauses and resumes the conversation
5. [ ] Messages are properly saved to the database during streaming

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 implementation
- ChatInterface.tsx component
- Supabase for message storage

## Notes
- Focus on implementing only the essential functionality first
- Prioritize getting the core streaming and tool execution working before any enhancements
- Begin with the editDocument tool, then add askUserQuestion once the basic flow is working
- Keep error handling simple but effective for this phase
