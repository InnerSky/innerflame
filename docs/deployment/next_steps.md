# Next Steps for Deployment

We've completed the setup for automated deployment of the InnerFlame backend to Google Cloud Run. Here's a summary of what's been done and what needs to be done next.

## What's Been Accomplished

1. âœ… Created a Dockerfile optimized for the monorepo structure
2. âœ… Created a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files
3. âœ… Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
4. âœ… Enhanced the health check endpoint for better monitoring
5. âœ… Updated CORS configuration to support production
6. âœ… Documented environment variables required for deployment
7. âœ… Created comprehensive deployment documentation

## What You Need to Do Next

1. **Set up Google Cloud Project**
   - Create a project in Google Cloud Console
   - Enable required APIs (Cloud Run, Container Registry)
   - Set up a service account with appropriate permissions
   - Download service account key

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - Add `GCP_PROJECT_ID` with your project ID
   - Add `GCP_SA_KEY` with the content of your service account key file
   - Add `FRONTEND_URL` with your production frontend URL(s)
   - Add Supabase and Claude API credentials as secrets

3. **Test Local Build** (optional but recommended)
   - Run `docker build -t innerflame-api .` to test the build process
   - Run the container locally with environment variables to test functionality

4. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Commit all the created/modified files
   - Push to the main branch to trigger deployment

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful workflow run
   - Test the deployed API using the health endpoint
   - Test frontend-backend connection

## Files Created/Modified

### Code Files
- Created `Dockerfile` for container build
- Created `.dockerignore` for excluding unnecessary files
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` for CI/CD
- Modified `apps/api/src/index.ts` to enhance health check and CORS

### Documentation Files
- Created `docs/deployment/environment_variables.md`
- Created `docs/deployment/google_cloud_setup.md`
- Created `docs/deployment/production_cors.md`
- Created `docs/deployment/next_steps.md` (this file)

## Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project ID |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | Service account key JSON contents |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Production frontend URL(s), comma-separated |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase instance URL |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | Supabase service role key |
| `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Claude API key |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | Claude model version (optional) |
| `CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS` | Claude max tokens (optional) |
